# The Zealot Skin

Simple mod that adds a Zealot skin to Laia

Made at the request of @pataco

A couple of notes:

This mod relies on [Obeliskial Content](https://across-the-obelisk.thunderstore.io/package/meds/Obeliskial_Content/).

## Installation (manual)

1. Install [Obeliskial Essentials](https://across-the-obelisk.thunderstore.io/package/meds/Obeliskial_Essentials/) and [Obeliskial Content](https://across-the-obelisk.thunderstore.io/package/meds/Obeliskial_Content/).
2. Click _Manual Download_ at the top of the page.
3. In Steam, right-click Across the Obelisk and select _Manage_->_Browse local files_.
4. Extract the archive into the game folder. Your `Across the Obelisk` folder should now contain a `BepInEx` folder and a `doorstop_libs` folder.
5. Run the game. If everything runs correctly, you will see this mod in the list of registered mods on the main menu.
6. Press F5 to open/close the Config Manager and F1 to show/hide mod version information.
7. Note: I am not certain about these install instructions. In the worst case, just copy `com.binbin.ZealotSkin.dll` into the `BepInEx\plugins` folder, and the _ZealotSkin_ folder (the one with the subfolders containing the json files) into `BepInEx\config\Obeliskial_importing`

## Installation (automatic)

1. Download and install [Thunderstore Mod Manager](https://www.overwolf.com/app/Thunderstore-Thunderstore_Mod_Manager) or [r2modman](https://across-the-obelisk.thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/).
2. Click **Install with Mod Manager** button on top of the page.
3. Run the game via the mod manager.
